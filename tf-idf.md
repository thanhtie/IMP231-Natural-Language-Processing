Step 1: count raw frequency of term in a document

Step 2: calculate the tf by divide raw frequency/(max of frequency in the document)

Step 3: calculate the df for each term

Step 4: calculate the tf-idf by using formula log2(N/df) Note: N is #total of document

Step 5: calculate tf-idf = tf * idf = tf * log2(N/df)
