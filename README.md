Max value -> detect full object
4-> detect similar object 

If don't know which object to detect -> how to design the kernel
+ stagegic-> assigning random value -> backpropergate until get optimal value

What is the disadvantage of traditional DL -> high computational problem -> CNN can reduce it a bit, how can it help this problem
