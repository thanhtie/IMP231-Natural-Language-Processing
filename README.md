Max value -> detect full object
4-> detect similar object 

If don't know which object to detect -> how to design the kernel
+ stagegic-> assigning random value -> backpropergate until get optimal value

What is the disadvantage of traditional DL -> high computational problem -> CNN can reduce it a bit, how can it help this problem
example
4x4 image -> 16 pixel -> flat to 16 input layer -> 

hidden layer -> asign random value for kernel -> 

why pick kernel size is 4 or 3:
