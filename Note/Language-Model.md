If the string is long -> the calcualtion is small for the first word -> hard for decoder to generate the word "tôi"

How can the machine know the word context of "school" is "học" -> current output "tôi đi" -> p(học|"tôi đi") -> pick prob for that
Need to know the 2 input to generate output:
+ what is the important input
+ what is the current output
